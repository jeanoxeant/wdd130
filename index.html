            <p> Hello! My name is Jean Rubin Oxeant. I am from Haiti. I am a civil engineer. I have a beautiful family with two sons. I am a member of the church of Jesus Christ and Latter Day Saints since 2005. I served a fulltime mission on 2007-2009. I love playing piano and reading. I love helping people. I had the opportunity to be professors’ assistant in PUCMM. That gave me opportunity to help some students to achieve their goal. I worked as a subcontractor engineer that gave me opportunity to hire many young men who did not have a job to take care of their family.
                I love teaching. In different occasion, I had the opportunity to teach people in different branches: like English, piano and so on…
                I am a hard worker. I like to finish anything that I start. I don’t like to start anything if I know that I will not be able to finish it. Enduring to the end is my passion. I love computer programming. Even though it’s a hard work to do, but I love challenging stuff.</p>
